# Overview
Induction machine is the most commonly used machines in domestic and industrial applications. When faults occur in an induction machine, it reduces the efficiency, consequently, decreases the performance of the machine. Bearing faults are the most frequent one among other faults that occur in an induction machine with a 40-45\% probability. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose the bearing faults accurately. In this report, a classification problem is carried out by using two ML-based classifiers namely decision tree and logistic regression in order to predict the healthy and faulty state of the induction machine.
